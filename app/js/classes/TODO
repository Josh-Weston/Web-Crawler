1) We need a window to track the audit at a high-level (records processed, elapsed time, etc.)
2) We need the option to view the audit window, or to hide-it. Default is hidden.
3) When an instruction fails, we need a screen print and and a console print.
4) It would be nice to develop a small tool to help us identify the elements we are clicking on, and the order of operations. This would
resemble some sort of audit recorder. This is definitely not that important right now.
5) We need classes that are client-side for carrying out the instructions and performing the audits. These classes will
be injected when the DOM is finished loading.
6) We need to be able to save everything as an "Audit Package" we can load. Most likely just JSON.
7) We need a window that allows us to load an audit package.
8) We need to some sort of kill-switch so we can stop the audit early.
9) Configure grunt to reload each time there is a change. Would also need to close existing windows.
