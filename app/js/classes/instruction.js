//Instruction is a single action to be performed. Suck as, enter information in a textbox, click submit,
//choose from a dropdown, etc.

//Types of instructions:

/*
1) Navigate = have the browser move to a new page (will require re-binding of our scripts)
2) Populate = add text to inputbox
3) Select = select option from select
4) Click = click something
5) Submit = submit a form

May need to figure out how to handle things like auto-complete, where the we are waiting for the page to finish
loading the available values?
